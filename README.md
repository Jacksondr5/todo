# Todo

A todo app that I actually use.

## Features

- Resilliant against network failure because some corporate networks are terrible
  - Able to work offline using local storage, syncs when network is available
- Super user oriented
  - Data entry, navigation, etc. done by keyboard
  - Command palette

## Todo style

- Tasks grouped into important/urgent matrix
- Tasks have a title
  - Optional description, due date, tags
  - Should they have priority? How would that work with important/urgent?
- Tasks have a blocked status. If the status is blocked, a reason must be provided.

## Keyboard commands

- Tab to go to next todo, shift + tab to go to previous todo
- E to edit todo title
- Q to mark as done
- A to add todo
- D to edit todo description
- F to edit todo due date
- T to edit todo tags
- I to edit todo importance
- U to edit todo urgency
- B to set todo as blocked
